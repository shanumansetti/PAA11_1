What Drives the Price of a Car?

The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The practice dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing. The objective of this project is to determine what factors make a car more or less expensive. After detailed analysis, a clear recommendation is provided to the client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.
